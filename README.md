## Oficial assingment:
Several human players (at least two) can manage their soccer teams out of a list of real soccer teams of several championships across Europe. Human players can pick their team and add / remove soccer players from a list of available free agents. There is a schedule of games and results will be generated taking into account the players’ characteristics (no need to have some advanced algorithm simulating games: just a simple randomization will do it!). Admin can put new soccer players in the main list of free agents and change their attributes before they are selected by other human players. If you want, you can implement a budget system for each team, so that players can be bought and sold based on the financial availability of teams.
